How to use the .xsd file to generate XML from Excel:
1. Download IV_CV_Map.xsd
2. Open the Excel worksheet
3. Click the Developer tab and go to Source under the XML heading
4. A window called "XML Source" will open.
5. On this window, click "XML Maps..." This will open another window.
6. Click "Add..." and locate IV_CV_Map.xsd, then click OK
7. In the "XML Source" window, a filesystem representation of the XML scheme will open
8. From here, drag and drop each element from the map to the corresponding element in the worksheet.
9. NOTE: in the case of the "DATA" elements, they map to an indefinite number of cells. To utilize, make sure there is a blank cell above the column of data, and map the element to that cell. Every element below will be mapped to that element.
10. Once every element is mapped, to export the file as an XML, go to the Developer tab and under the XML heading click Export. The filesystem will open and prompt for a save name and location. This saved fill will be in the XML format and ready to be uploaded to the database.
11. NOTE: In order to use the graph visualizer in the database, at the very least, the RUN->RUN_NAME and DATA->VOLTAGE_VOLT elements must be mapped, along with DATA->ACTV_CURRENT_AMP for the IV data and DATA->ACTV_CAP_FRD for the CV data.
